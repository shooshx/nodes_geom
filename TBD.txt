GUI:
- color picker with null
- BUG: resize the window beyond the size of the nodes panel moves it
- select *nodes* with Ctrl, rectangle (display params of multiple nodes at once?)
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- before running - do type checking
- progress bar for long run
- first node created with display flag (otherwise nothing is visible)
- fix jumping of splits on load
- template display
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?

ENGINE:
- parser in parameter
    - attributes in parameters?

NODES:
- any square (primitive, webgl, image)
    dials for resizing
- mouse vertices - mesh
    - delete point from list control
    - select with rectangle
    - move them even after transform?
    - edit coords with input
- mouse polyline
- polyline fill
    Path2D
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths
- Primitive Circle
- Scatter (random points) BUG  
    moving the input geom should not change everything (should be relative to the bbox?)
- attribute sample
    point size sample from image
- Manual points
    point size
- round edges
- transform invert
- single value input using a slider
- random points
    too slow - add KdTree
    exact shape, not bbox (clip)
- interactive
    mouse input
- Group objects
    display checkboxes
- GLSL node
    - render not into a frame-buffer that covers all the canavas, but a buffer that can be placed and moved
        (solves SetAttr sampling outside the screen so it doesn't have a color)
        image content should not be dependent on zoom or pan...

    title of window with different color for fragment and vertex shaders
    tabbed view?
- point size to path circle
- *** bitmap from file with upload to imgur
- bitmap trace

- delete points outside a shape (crop>)
    node for clip using a path
- convex hull

- random points  - https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/scatter.html
    on a surface
    on a line
    interpolate property from input geometry

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

nodes the produce transform, invert it
try for changing pivot T1 * Tp1 * R * Tp1' = T2 * Tp2 * R * Tp



NODE-VIEW
- better lines the go up
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type


DISCOVERABILITY
- hover tooltip on terminals
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver

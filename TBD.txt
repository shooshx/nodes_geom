GUI:
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- before running - do type checking
- color picker with null
- BUG: resize the window beyond the size of the nodes panel moves it
- select *nodes* with Ctrl, rectangle (display params of multiple nodes at once?)
- zoom nodes view
- icons nodes view
- node show node name if name is changed
- progress bar for long run, abort button
- first node created with display flag (otherwise nothing is visible)
- fix jumping of splits on page load
- template display
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- save the image-canvas view transform


ENGINE:
- serialization - save only if something is changed
- save to SVG


NODES:
- frame buffer
    clone object
    merge create and shader
- Geom primitive
    - rect round edges
    - spiral
    - !! 2d function of t, sampled at intervals
    - free-hand path, min step distance
- manual geom
    - delete point from list control
    - move them even after transform?
    - primitive quad, triangle, path between the points? by selection?
    - curve control points
    - BUG - yellow appears in the second column but isn't updating when changing selection
    - point size
- Divide triangles - for better interpolation
    - unifies vertices?
- polyline fill
    UI for closing and starting a new poly, bugs with this
    triangulation
        edge case of non-input points coming from triangulate (corner points) ??? don't know how to do this
        add non-hole points?
    show arrows with on the lines to show its direction
- SetAttr
    pseudo attribute - face center (position) so that it will be possible to sample face color from the position attribute
    normals?
- SetAttr fill from node 
   - transform fill along with the shape or not
   - fill vertices circles?
- RoundCourners
   - BUG - !!! not working in saved piece paths after SetAttr
   - BUG - !!! not keeping fill
- round edges
- transform invert
- transform - fit one object to another? paper.js fitBounds
- interactive
    mouse input, adjust minimimum step (http://paperjs.org/tutorials/images/color-averaging-image-areas/)
- Group objects
    display checkboxes (accumulate from connections?)
- GLSL node

    simplex?
- Load-Image
    menu on the side to load presets?
- point size to path circle
    and lines -- according to changing width
- bitmap trace
    potrace -  https://github.com/kilobtye/potrace/blob/master/potrace.js
        http://potrace.sourceforge.net/  
- delete points outside a shape (crop)
    node for clip using a path
- convex hull
- Copy - copy something onto vertices positions
    how to control parameters of the copies?
    for loop?
- Boolean ops

    interpolate property from input geometry
- Graph (4) coloring - for selecting some vertices at seemingly random
- 3D model and render
- Text paths  https://opentype.js.org/
- Mesh merge, path merge
- Shrink faces 
    - with expression depending on vtx_pos or any other attr
    - BUG with saved voronoi - misses some faces on the edges
    - BUG not keeping fill of the original

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter


nodes the produce transform, invert it


PAPER.JS
- create objects without canvas?
- internal represnentation
- smooth, simplify
- offset - https://github.com/luz-alphacode/paperjs-offset

EXPRESSIONS
- boolean comparisons operator ?:
- intellisense
- vec2 normalize - context menu that makes 2 edit boxes into 1 edit box with vec2 expr
    - scale to object space coordinate
- !! in any params view that can have expressions, add a custom user parameter that can be used with a slider
    - and added to the object that carries it
- unify ParamColor and ParamExprColor
- expression in color in table

NODE-VIEW
- better lines the go up
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type
- comments, frames, change color of node

DISCOVERABILITY
- hover tooltip on terminals
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver
- topograph with gradient
- something looking like https://github.com/stolk/allrgb
- rainbow gradient like clock - radial with rays towards infinity (conic gradient) https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pyOadx/
- ascii art
- spiral with width according to color (http://paperjs.org/examples/spiral-raster/)
- http://paperjs.org/examples/

GUI:
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- before running - do type checking
- color picker with null
- BUG: resize the window beyond the size of the nodes panel moves it
- select *nodes* with Ctrl, rectangle (display params of multiple nodes at once?)
- zoom nodes view
- icons nodes view
- node show node name if name is changed
- progress bar for long run, abort button
- first node created with display flag (otherwise nothing is visible)
- fix jumping of splits on page load
- template display
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- save the image-canvas view transform


ENGINE:
- serialization - save only if something is changed
- save to SVG

NODES:
- frame buffer
    clone object
    merge create and shader
- any square (primitive, webgl, image)
    !!! dials for resizing
- manual geom
    - delete point from list control
    - move them even after transform?
    - primitive quad, triangle, path between the points? by selection?
    - curve control points
    - BUG - yellow appears in the second column but isn't updating when changing selection
- Divide triangles - for better interpolation
    - unifies vertices?
- polyline fill
    UI for closing and starting a new poly, bugs with this
    triangulation
        edge case of non-input points coming from triangulate (corner points) ??? don't know how to do this
        add non-hole points?
    transform?
    show arrows with on the lines to show its direction
- SetAttr
    pseudo attribute - face center (position) so that it will be possible to sample face color from the position attribute
- Manual points
    point size
- round edges
- transform invert
- interactive
    mouse input
- Group objects
    display checkboxes (accumulate from connections?)
- GLSL node

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27531860/how-to-highlight-a-certain-line-in-ace-editor
    title of window with different color for fragment and vertex shaders
    tabbed view?
- Image processing  http://evanw.github.io/webgl-filter/
- !!!! Perlin Noise GLSL?

    https://github.com/shooshx/kawaiigl/blob/0f403512b49187b677865179f3ef5eb18433b68b/NoiseGenerator.cpp
    simplex?
- point size to path circle
    and lines -- according to changing width
- bitmap trace
    potrace -  https://github.com/kilobtye/potrace/blob/master/potrace.js
        http://potrace.sourceforge.net/  
- delete points outside a shape (crop)
    node for clip using a path
- convex hull
- Copy - copy something onto vertices positions
    how to control parameters of the copies?
    for loop?
- Boolean ops from Inkscape https://gitlab.com/inkscape/lib2geom/blob/master/src/2geom/intersection-graph.h
- Gradient
    !!!with a 1d expression function
    spreadMethod with SVG  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/spreadMethod
    fill, stroke,
- !! 2d color function, sampling gradient
- random points  - https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/scatter.html
    on a surface
    on a line
    interpolate property from input geometry


- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

nodes the produce transform, invert it



EXPRESSIONS
- in transform params
- boolean comparisons operator ?:
- intellisense
- vec2 normalize - require vec2 values
    - scale to object space coordinate
- !!!!! pi


NODE-VIEW
- better lines the go up
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type
- comments, frames, change color of node

DISCOVERABILITY
- hover tooltip on terminals
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver
- topograph with gradient
- something looking like https://github.com/stolk/allrgb
- rainbow gradient like clock - radial with rays towards infinity (conic gradient) https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pyOadx/
- ascii art

transform for each node

NODES:
mouse vertices
color per vertex? for gradient
triangulation
round edges

nodes the produce transform, invert it
try for changing pivot T1 * Tp1 * R * Tp1' = T2 * Tp2 * R * Tp


NOVE-VIEW
- arrow heads
- better lines
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input

GUI:
- catch assert and show error on node   (!!)
- save as
- transform UI, for each node
- parameter with drag and right button
- before running - do type checking
- round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- space forces redraw
- template display

ENGINE:
- too many triggers when clicking on display of points color

NODES:
- mouse vertices - polyline
- Primitive Circle
- color per vertex? for gradient
- triangulation
- round edges
- transform invert
- single value input using a slider

- grid of points - actually divide

- random points  - https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/scatter.html
    on a surface
    on a line
    interpolate property from input geometry

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

nodes the produce transform, invert it
try for changing pivot T1 * Tp1 * R * Tp1' = T2 * Tp2 * R * Tp



NOVE-VIEW
- arrow heads
- better lines
- delete lines
- hover tooltip on terminals
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input


demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw

GUI:
- !!! param panel overflow
- color picker with null
- image-view reset transform with context menu
- save as
- transform UI, for each node
- select objects with Ctrl, rectangle
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- before running - do type checking
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- progress bar for long run
- first node created with display flag (otherwise nothing is visible)

- template display


ENGINE:
- distribute output only to active lines!!
- too many triggers when clicking on display of points color
- display options show only vtx,stroke or fill, per node, visible only when on display

NODES:
- mouse vertices - mesh
    - !!!! delete points doesn't work
    - !!!! delete point from list
    - !!!! points drag not according to zoom
    - select with rectangle
    - move them even after transform?
    - edit coords with input
- mouse polyline
- polyline fill
- Primitive Circle
- attribute sample
    color
    point size sample from image
- Manual points
    point size
- round edges
- transform invert
- single value input using a slider
- random points
    too slow - add KdTree
- interactive
    mouse input
- GLSL node

    title of window with different color for fragment and vertex shaders
    tabbed view?
- point size to path circle
- *** bitmap from file with upload to imgur
- bitmap trace

- grid of points - actually divide

- random points  - https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/scatter.html
    on a surface
    on a line
    interpolate property from input geometry

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

nodes the produce transform, invert it
try for changing pivot T1 * Tp1 * R * Tp1' = T2 * Tp2 * R * Tp



NODE-VIEW
- arrow heads
- better lines
- delete lines
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type


DISCOVERABILITY
- hover tooltip on terminals
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver

GUI:
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- color picker with null?
- select *nodes* with Ctrl, rectangle (display params of multiple nodes at once?)
- zoom nodes view
- icons nodes view
- node show node name class if name doesn't include it
- progress bar for long run, abort button
- fix jumping of splits on page load
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- layout: https://github.com/golden-layout/golden-layout
- right click? on out terminal to show info about its output
- define camera?
- !!!!! input nodes are only active if they are in a current display tree
- !! ability to resize code editor and pop it out
- global input indicator that can be quickly turned off


ENGINE:
- before running - do type checking to nodes in/out terminals
- serialization - save only if something is changed
- save to SVG
- !!!!!! save to PNG
- !!! download all saves backup
- Animation using frame variable
- https://jshint.com/
- texture leaks?
- !!! frame buffer transform??
    - or maybe func transform?
    - explicit error
 -figure out constness of images thing (can't get mutable ref?)
    - also texture destructor

EXPRESSIONS
- boolean comparisons operator ?: - better than if(,,) since false side is not evaluated
- intellisense
- ?? in any params view that can have expressions, add a custom user parameter that can be used with a slider
    - and added to the object that carries it
- expression in color in table (gradient)
- code for transform param
- expression in color box
- swizzle
- func with 0 argument has a bug in parse
- remove exponent opertor instead do it on number parsing
- *** Vec2Int (resolution image)
- default() to give value to non-existing variable - not so easy...
- line in errors


****** CURRENT AGENDA ******
- terminal dirty in Variables?
- optiomize, load Yaml
    dialog for delete from state
- code editor
- mesh merge
- swizzle
- glsl compilation error not visible
- gradient as image source to func - new type
    - cache in ensure_svg
    - rotate fast to 0 makes it skip frames?
    - sampler gradient with no points
- interpolate between two gradients
- render any geometry to texture
    extend point-gradient

- Manual geom move -  maybe manual with multiple targets?
- allow terminal name change backwards compatibility - in_tex to in_framebuffer
- green coordinates

     - transform manual geom
     - transform image?


NODES:
- frame buffer
    - clone object consistent with the rest of the system
    - merge create and shader?
    - variable ratio, not just square, take the ratio of the current viewport
        - !!!!!! pixel buffer ratio according to resolution ratio (with checkbox - square pixels)
    - canvas set_width takes a long time, use a pool of canvases
- Geom primitive
    - rect round edges
    - spiral
    - 2d function of t, sampled at intervals
    - free-hand path, min step distance
- manual geom
    - delete point from list control gui
    - ??? move them even after transform?
    - primitive quad, triangle, path - between the points? by selection?
    - Path curve control points
    - point size
    - BUG - yellow line doesn't follow the selected point
    - make several versions of the arrays in the same object and a node to select version - instead of a modify node
- Divide 
    - triangles - for better interpolation
    - unifies vertices?
    - divide line to sub lines, curves
    -  unify sublines into a single line? = different node
- polyline fill
    UI for closing and starting a new poly, bugs with this
    triangulation
        edge case of non-input points coming from triangulate (corner points) ??? don't know how to do this
        add non-hole points?
    show arrows with on the lines to show its direction  
- triangulate  
    check why there's jumping when triangulating a primitive pentagon
- Paths 
    show directionality of polygons
- SetAttr 
   - sample gradient in code
   - fill-from-node transform fill along with the shape 
      - need a shader to avoid many many renderings - need a separate node to render this
   - fill vertices circles?
   - !!! line color, width
   - !!!!!!!! open a table with the actual values of the vertices / faces
   - line attributes color
        - line as gradient between vertices colors
- transform invert - in expression?
- transform - fit one object to another? paper.js fitBounds
- interactive
    mouse input, adjust minimimum step (http://paperjs.org/tutorials/images/color-averaging-image-areas/)
- Group objects
    display display checkboxes (accumulate from connections?)

    simplex?
- Load-Image
    video
    menu on the side to load presets?
    !!! know when the user changed the filename and set size only when that happens and not on pis_dirty which happens on load
- point size to path circle
    and lines -- according to changing width
- bitmap trace

    - bug with oversizing divided square - lighten doesn't get rid of first point of merge
    - discretization of bezier (and back to bezier from paperjs?)
    - detect what points are coming from round corner, convert to bezier

- Anim: Accumulate geometry every N frames
- Anim: object feedback - from specific frame, every N frame, from N frames in the past (delay line)

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

- nodes the produce transform, invert it

- Variable with global memory - initialization (when?) and change trigger
- Variable from geometry of previous frame?


PAPER.JS
- smooth, simplify
- offset - https://github.com/luz-alphacode/paperjs-offset



NODE-VIEW
- better lines the go up
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type
- comments, frames, change color of node

DISCOVERABILITY
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver
- topograph with gradient
- something looking like https://github.com/stolk/allrgb
- rainbow gradient like clock - radial with rays towards infinity (conic gradient) https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pyOadx/
- ascii art
- spiral with width according to color (http://paperjs.org/examples/spiral-raster/)

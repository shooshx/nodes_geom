GUI:
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- before running - do type checking
- color picker with null
- BUG: resize the window beyond the size of the nodes panel moves it
- select *nodes* with Ctrl, rectangle (display params of multiple nodes at once?)
- zoom nodes view
- icons nodes view
- node show node name if name is changed
- progress bar for long run, abort button
- first node created with display flag (otherwise nothing is visible)
- fix jumping of splits on page load
- template display
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- icons for nodes
- save the image view transform

ENGINE:
- parser in parameter
    - attributes in parameters?
- serialization - save only if something is changed

NODES:
- frame buffer
    clone object
    merge create and shader
- any square (primitive, webgl, image)
    dials for resizing
- manual geom
    - delete point from list control
    - move them even after transform?
    - primitive quad, triangle, path between the points? by selection?
    - curve control points
- polyline fill
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths
    UI for closing and starting a new poly, bugs with this
    triangulation
        edge case of non-input points coming from triangulate (corner points) ??? don't know how to do this
        add non-hole points?
- SetAttr
    pseudo attribute - face center (position) so that it will be possible to sample face color from the position attribute
- Manual points
    point size
- round edges
- transform invert
- single value input using a slider
- interactive
    mouse input
- Group objects
    display checkboxes
- GLSL node
    - render not into a frame-buffer that covers all the canavas, but a buffer that can be placed and moved
        (solves SetAttr sampling outside the screen so it doesn't have a color)
        image content should not be dependent on zoom or pan...

    title of window with different color for fragment and vertex shaders
    tabbed view?
- Image processing  http://evanw.github.io/webgl-filter/
- Perlin Noise GLSL?
    https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/tree/master/src
- point size to path circle
    and lines -- according to changing width
- bitmap trace

- delete points outside a shape (crop)
    node for clip using a path
- convex hull
- Copy - copy something onto vertices positions
    how to control parameters of the copies?
    for loop?

- Boolean ops from Inkscape https://gitlab.com/inkscape/lib2geom/blob/master/src/2geom/intersection-graph.h
- Shrink for paths (not trivial)
- !!! Gradient object, fill, stroke, 


- random points  - https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/scatter.html
    on a surface
    on a line
    interpolate property from input geometry

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

nodes the produce transform, invert it



EXPRESSIONS
- in transform params
- boolean comparisons operator ?:
- intellisense
- vec2 normalize - require vec2 values
    - scale to object space coordinate


NODE-VIEW
- better lines the go up
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type


DISCOVERABILITY
- hover tooltip on terminals
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver
- topograph with gradient
- something looking like https://github.com/stolk/allrgb

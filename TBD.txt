GUI:
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- color picker with null?
- select *nodes* rectangle 
- icons nodes view
- node show node name class if name doesn't include it
- progress bar for long run, abort button
- fix jumping of splits on page load
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- layout: https://github.com/golden-layout/golden-layout
- define camera?
- !!!!! input nodes are only active if they are in a current display tree
- global input indicator that can be quickly turned off
- log slider (mandelbrot)
- Display param control default vertex size


ENGINE:
- before running - do type checking to nodes in/out terminals
- serialization - save only if something is changed
- save to SVG
- !!! download all saves backup
- https://jshint.com/
- texture leaks?
- !!! frame buffer transform??
    - or maybe func transform?
    - explicit error
-figure out constness of images thing (can't get mutable ref?)
    - also texture destructor
- fix spurious runs on mousemove right after change (when async?)
- Copy-Paste nodes
- skip check-type on everything on load


EXPRESSIONS
- intellisense
- ?? in any params view that can have expressions, add a custom user parameter that can be used with a slider
    - and added to the object that carries it
- expression in color in table (gradient)
- code for transform param
- expression in color box
- swizzle
- func with 0 argument has a bug in parse
- remove exponent opertor instead do it on number parsing
- *** Vec2Int (resolution image)
- default() to give value to non-existing variable - not so easy...
- check CodeMirror
- line errors for ExprErr outside main parsing (line in node)
    for mesh stuff eassert
- colors [0-1] everywhere (set attr)
- SetAttr with null return to do nothing like in fill
    -none value for function
- Sample any param from any node ???

**** Animation program ****
  - set var
        unify var and span
        internal enable that's not saved, what about inital value?
  - event node 
        parameter for internal enable
        start is just an event for pulse variable controlled by the button
        interrupt event
  - visualize where control is
  - assert()s in flow nodes
  - span node
    - frame rate: 
        - custom?
    - stop at: 
        - condition 
            - variable trigger
  - action node
     - sets global variable (frame_num = X)
  - start trigger node?
    - animation reset (pressed play when frame_num == 0)   
    - some pulse? (button press)? overrides normal anim?
  - subroutine call on trigger?  

**** loop ****
- reduce - collect is always to a group object
  - geom merge can take a group and make merge it
- new kind of terminal for reduce
- for over range
- for over vertices in an object
- for node produces an iterator object? 
    - contains details about the current vertex,  
    - is a variable
    - can be end iterator
    - distributed to several?
- engine magic when seeing an iterator object
   - if a node outputs an iterator object, it gets run calls as long as it didn't output and end iterator
   - run iterator gets run calls 
- collector permanently connected with the loop var node
- collector triggers engine to start the chain above it again, as long as it's not seeing an end iterator

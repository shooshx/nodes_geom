GUI:
- parameter value change with drag and right button like in houdini
- before running - do type checking to nodes in/out terminals
- color picker with null?
- BUG: resize the window beyond the size of the nodes panel moves it
- select *nodes* with Ctrl, rectangle (display params of multiple nodes at once?)
- zoom nodes view
- icons nodes view
- node show node name class if name doesn't include it
- progress bar for long run, abort button
- first node created with display flag (otherwise nothing is visible)
- fix jumping of splits on page load
- Math.round lines just before drawing to avoid thinning artifacts when zooming?
- layout: https://github.com/golden-layout/golden-layout
- right click? on out terminal to show info about its output
- define camera?


ENGINE:
- serialization - save only if something is changed
- save to SVG
- !!!!!! save to PNG
- !!! download all saves backup
- Animation using frame variable
- ParamSelect - can get value instead of sel_idx (in gradient spread)
- https://jshint.com/
- texture leaks?
- !!! frame buffer transform??
    - or maybe func transform?
    - explicit error



EXPRESSIONS
- boolean comparisons operator ?: - better than if(,,) since false side is not evaluated
- intellisense
- ?? in any params view that can have expressions, add a custom user parameter that can be used with a slider
    - and added to the object that carries it
- expression in color in table (gradient)
- transform with code
- clear_all should also clear expressions cache
- !!! code for transform param
- assign to subscript col.r = 222
- expression in color box
- swizzle
- func with 0 argument has a bug in parse


****** CURRENT AGENDA ******
- Param2d short expression, slider
- Image transform spiral from kawaiig
- render geometry to texture
- Manual geom move
- green coordinates
     - https://github.com/ugomadagu/Krita/blob/7626a015269510c13bf92268d00ad3fb13107e96/libs/image/kis_green_coordinates_math.cpp
     - http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~ylipman/GC/gc_techrep.pdf
     - transform manual geom
     - transform image?


NODES:
- frame buffer
    - clone object consistent with the rest of the system
    - merge create and shader?
    - variable ratio, not just square, take the ratio of the current viewport
        - !!!!!! pixel buffer ratio according to resolution ratio (with checkbox - square pixels)
- Geom primitive
    - rect round edges
    - spiral
    - 2d function of t, sampled at intervals
    - free-hand path, min step distance
- manual geom
    - delete point from list control gui
    - ??? move them even after transform?
    - primitive quad, triangle, path - between the points? by selection?
    - Path curve control points
    - point size
    - BUG - yellow line doesn't follow the selected point
- Divide 
    - triangles - for better interpolation
    - unifies vertices?
    - divide line to sub lines, curves
    -  unify sublines into a single line? = different node
- polyline fill
    UI for closing and starting a new poly, bugs with this
    triangulation
        edge case of non-input points coming from triangulate (corner points) ??? don't know how to do this
        add non-hole points?
    show arrows with on the lines to show its direction  
- triangulate  
    check why there's jumping when triangulating a primitive pentagon  
- SetAttr 
   - fill-from-node transform fill along with the shape 
      - need a shader to avoid many many renderings - need a separate node to render this
   - fill vertices circles?
   - !!! line color, width
   - !!!!!!!! open a table with the actual values of the vertices / faces
   - line attributes color
- transform invert - in expression?
- transform - fit one object to another? paper.js fitBounds
- interactive
    mouse input, adjust minimimum step (http://paperjs.org/tutorials/images/color-averaging-image-areas/)
- Group objects
    display display checkboxes (accumulate from connections?)
- GLSL node

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27531860/how-to-highlight-a-certain-line-in-ace-editor
    title of window with different color for fragment and vertex shaders
    tabbed view?

    simplex?
- Load-Image
    menu on the side to load presets?
- point size to path circle
    and lines -- according to changing width
- bitmap trace
    potrace -  https://github.com/kilobtye/potrace/blob/master/potrace.js

    how to control parameters of the copies?
    for loop?
- Gradient
    in stroke (line),
    add nice presets
- 2d color function
    - time
- random points  - https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/scatter.html
    on a surface
    on a line
    interpolate property from input geometry

- Anim: Accumulate geometry every N frames
- Anim: object feedback - from specific frame, every N frame, from N frames in the past (delay line)

- animate? modify a property for the next frame
- random color with r,g,b ranges and seed parameter

nodes the produce transform, invert it


PAPER.JS
- smooth, simplify
- offset - https://github.com/luz-alphacode/paperjs-offset



NODE-VIEW
- better lines the go up
- don't allow connect more than one thing into an input, unless it's a multi-input
- terminal color according to type
- comments, frames, change color of node

DISCOVERABILITY
- detailed explanation about a node when selecting it in a tooltip and in the params

demo idea
- random points with random colors that make a field of polygons, animated to move slightly
- robot hand with transformations
- random points by texture
- stuff for AxiDraw
- function map with color gradient
- function contours like in d3 example
- star field screen saver
- topograph with gradient
- something looking like https://github.com/stolk/allrgb
- rainbow gradient like clock - radial with rays towards infinity (conic gradient) https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pyOadx/
- ascii art
- spiral with width according to color (http://paperjs.org/examples/spiral-raster/)
- http://paperjs.org/examples/
- image effects http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/deform/deform.htm

The engine runs nodes
- runs variables resolve
- find the roots that need to be displayed (display node, template)
- maps from the roots who are the nodes that are dirty
    - need to be a separate step from run() step since run() may trigger dirtyness
- runs the dirty nodes and down towards the root

Node becomes dirty by
- parameter change
- connect/disconnect of a terminal
- The object in one of its terminals changed
    This is needed for A->B, when the user displays A, changes it, then displays B - B needs to be invalidated and not hold on to old object

Colors
- when dealing with images, ranges is 0-255 to r,g,b,alphai and 0-1 to alpha, as sampled from images
- when dealing with shaders, webgl, all is in range 0-1
    - ParamColor scales its values before doing gl.uniform
    - mesh attributes use need_normalize
    - shader coder expects to get values in [0-1]

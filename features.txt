**** Application ****
- Import and export programs to readable YAML
- Display the output of a single selected node marked with the blue display flag
- Display outline of any number of "template" outputs of nodes marked with the template flag

**** Expression Engine ****

- Variable nodes can calculate and distribute values to other nodes


**** Nodes ****

Node: Geom Primitive
- Create a simple geometry Primitive
- Rect, rect with triangles, ellipse (circle), regular polygon, star shape
- Base size and Transform

Node: Manual Geometry
- Create a collection of vertices (Mesh) or closed straight-line paths
- Control color of every vertex
- Input exact coordinates by clicking the coordinate in the table

Node: Gradient
- Create linear, radial and sampler gradient
    - sampler are gradients without geometry used for function sampling see Node Func
- Edit geometry, edit color stop points and colors
- Edit exact position of stop by clicking in the table
- Control gradient spread beyond edges: pad, repeat, reflect
- generate stops using a function of t
    - "return rgb(255,128,0) + rgb(t, t, t)*255"
- Control smoothing and resolution in case it's rendered to a texture
- Load a preset gradient

Node: Divide
- Divide each quad in a quad mesh into smaller quads
- by a constant number of division or a constant required distance

Node: Set Attribute
- Set an attribute of vertices or faces of gemortry to a constant, sampled or calculated value
- Set attribute name, type and object to bind to (vertices or faces)
- types: float, vec2 (normal), color (vec4), image-fill, transform
- Sample color value from an image or gradient
- Calculate value according to vertex or face position
- Expression possibilites:
    - Any atteibute that already exists the input bound objects (in_obj.vtx_pos.x, in_obj.face_color.r)
    - Color from the source input (in_src to get the color vec4, in_src.r for just red)
    - computed attributes: 
        in_obj.face_center: geomtric center of face (vec3)
- special attribute names:
    - pos (vertex) - vertex position
    - color (vertex and face) - fill color
    - radius (vertex) - of the vertex circle
    - fill (face, with type:image-fill) - makes the input geometry a clipping path for the source
    - transform (vertex and face) - change position/rotation per vertex or per face

Node: Group Objects
